## BM25F

The `BM25FScoringFunction` class implements the BM25F scoring function, which is used for document ranking based on the frequency of query terms and their distribution across different fields like `title`, `body`, and `author`. It uses parameters such as `k1` and `b` to adjust term frequency and field length normalization. 

The class includes:
- A method to build a dictionary of postings for quick lookup.
- A `__call__` method to calculate the document score by iterating over the query terms.
- A helper method `_rsv` to compute the **relevance score** based on term frequency and inverse document frequency (IDF).
- A method `_wtf` to calculate **term frequency** with field-specific **weight** adjustments and length normalization.

This structure enables efficient BM25F-based scoring for document retrieval.
