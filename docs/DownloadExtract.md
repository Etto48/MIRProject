## Download Indices

This code defines a function `download_and_extract()` that facilitates downloading and extracting pre-built indices from a given URL.

We use it because indexing on Colab wasn't feasible. Our indexing process took about 1 hour, whereas PyTerrier completed it in approximately 15 minutes on a machine equipped with a AMD Ryzen 9 9900X CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER GPU.
