## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to develop an Information Retrieval (IR) system by leveraging both well-established techniques, such as BM25, and more advanced approaches, including a learning-to-rank model powered by a BERT-based language model.

We used the [MSMarco Dataset](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/).
