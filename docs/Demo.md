## Evaluation of the System

Now, let's proceed with evaluating our system using the MS-MARCO test-set and compare the results with those obtained from PyTerrier.

Note: For inference time reasons, the demo will only run a subset of the test topics. However, we will report the full results at the end of the notebook.
